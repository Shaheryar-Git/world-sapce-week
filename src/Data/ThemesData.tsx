  description: "The theme for World Space Week 2024, “Space & Climate Change,” highlights the crucial role space technologies play in addressing one of the most pressing global challenges—climate change. From monitoring Earth’s changing climate to developing innovative solutions for sustainability, space is at the forefront of our efforts to protect the planet.\n\nWith advancements in satellite technology and data analytics, we now have unprecedented access to detailed environmental data, enabling more accurate climate modeling and informed decision-making. Space-based solutions are empowering governments, industries, and communities worldwide to mitigate the impacts of climate change and adapt to its effects.\n\nWorld Space Week 2024 aims to inspire students globally to pursue STEM education, emphasizing the importance of space technology in climate science. It will also serve as a platform for critical discussions on leveraging space innovations to build a more sustainable future for all.",

      "Sustainability in space relates to how humanity uses space — most pressingly, the orbital area surrounding Earth, itself a finite resource. At the start of 2021, there were 6,542 satellites listed in orbit by the UN. To ensure the sustainability of future space activities, we must clean up space debris and prevent threats to future missions. Achieving sustainability from space means using space to help create a cleaner, fairer, and safer planet Earth — including measuring climate change, identifying pollution, and supporting agriculture in developing nations. Of the 169 targets in the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals, 65 directly benefit from Earth observation satellites and related technologies.",
